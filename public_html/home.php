							<h2>What We Do</h2>
							<p>Hippo Development creates marketplace applications in order to optimize flow between clients and their desired good or service.</p>
							<h2>What Makes Us Special</h2>
							<p>Hippo development has two major components. The first, Hippo Development, is a traditional client/service model particularly for market space applications. The second is Hippo Innovation, a collaborative team of tech professionals with additional unique backgrounds that collaborate to create innovative applications that answer a clear need in the marketplace. Hippo Innovations also houses our marketing and social media consulting team.</p>
							<h2>Why the Hippo?</h2>
							<p>The hippo is Africa’s most feared and powerful animal. It is extremely territorial and yet also has a nobility found almost nowhere else in the animal kingdom. After a hippo has removed invading alligators, he allows for birds, fish, and antelope to drink and play in his waters. In a similar way, the members of Hippo Corp.  are territorial about our clients and tenacious about our leads. Yet also seek to create a wonderful ecosystem of innovation for our company to grow and foster. Hippo Corp. embodies the ferocious nobility of the Hippo.</p>

						<h2>Brand</h2>
						<h3>Why the Hippo?</h3>
						<p>The hippo is Africa’s most feared and powerful animal. It is extremely territorial and yet also has a nobility found almost nowhere else in the animal kingdom. After a hippo has removed invading alligators, he allows for birds, fish, and antelope to drink and play in his waters. In a similar way, the members of Hippo Corp.  are territorial about our clients and tenacious about our leads. Yet also seek to create a wonderful ecosystem of innovation for our company to grow and foster. Hippo Corp. embodies the ferocious nobility of the Hippo.</p>
